Notes
```
- All notes are provided to help not spoonfeed
- If you want to add a new value to the `config.yml` make sure to add it to `config.ts` too
- Adding new commands is pretty easy just add a new file and copy the template, easy right?
- ESlint has been added (and set to be as strict as possible) in here for extra help to help you style your code to be better (you can press `ctrl + shift + p` then click `ESlint: Fix all auto-fixable Problems` for some quick savers)
- Alternatly you can use `eslint "**"` in the terminal to find any eslint problem 
- You can use `ctrl + k then v` to open a visual editor for and `.md` files

- (Make sure to install the "eslint" and "markdown preview enhanced" plugins on visual studio code)
